## Introduction

This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the Boston Housing dataset. The primary objective is to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build regression models to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) in the Boston area. The analysis involves handling outliers, multicollinearity, normalization/standardization, and evaluating different regression models.

### Dataset

The dataset contains information on various attributes of housing in the Boston area, including crime rate, number of rooms, property tax rate, and more. The attributes are defined as follows:

	•	CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
	•	ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
	•	INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
	•	CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
	•	NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
	•	RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
	•	AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
	•	DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
	•	RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
	•	TAX: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
	•	PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
	•	B: 1000(Bk−0.63)², where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
	•	LSTAT: % lower status of the population
	•	MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

### Steps and Methodology

1. Setup and Data Loading

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset from Google Drive.

2. Data Inspection

Using df.head(), df.info(), and df.describe(), we inspect the data to understand its structure and summary statistics.

3. Handling Missing Values

We check for missing values using df.isna().sum(), and confirm that there are no missing values in the dataset.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

	•	Correlation Matrix: We calculate and visualize the correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.
	•	Outliers: We use boxplots to identify and visualize outliers in different columns.
	•	Scatter Plots: We plot scatter plots for selected features against the target variable (MEDV) to understand their relationships.

5. Data Preprocessing

	•	Normalization/Standardization: We normalize or standardize the data to bring all variables to a comparable scale.
	•	Binning: We create bins for columns with many outliers to reduce their impact on the model.
	•	Encoding: We use label encoding for ordinal features and one-hot encoding for categorical features.

6. Multicollinearity Check

We calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each feature to check for multicollinearity. Features with high VIF values are noted for potential removal or transformation.

7. Model Building

We build and evaluate multiple regression models:

	•	Linear Regression
	•	Ridge Regression
	•	Lasso Regression

8. Model Evaluation

We evaluate the models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics to determine their performance.

9. Analysis and Recommendations

Based on the evaluation metrics, we analyze the performance of each model and provide recommendations for model selection and further improvements.

### Conclusion

The notebook provides a thorough analysis of the Boston Housing dataset, highlighting important preprocessing steps, EDA, and model evaluation techniques. It serves as a practical guide for building regression models and understanding the underlying patterns in the data.

### How to Use
